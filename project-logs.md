# Works

## index.js
- Check for conditions to add todo without duedate/priority. Pass to addTodoItemDOM

## html css
- projects class - instead of option, use div. search dropdown. Update css accordingly
- upon selecting a todo, it should look like the keeps notes

## project.js
- project should have an id. Use that id in html div
- how to add id automatically for every obj like database?

# Ideas

## Projects
- bar button shows manage projects
- project name is clickable and shows other projects in a dropdown menu
- one project name is 'random'. If a project is deleted, the items on that project is dumped into 'random'.
- shift a todo to different project?
  
## Todo list
- on click, darkens everything else and shows the todo in the middle and enlarged.
- if there's no text in a todo, it is removed from the list.
